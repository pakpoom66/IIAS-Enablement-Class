# Class Prerequisites

  In preparation for the class we have created a VM image what contains Harmony Profiler, Db2 Client, Db2 Warehouse.   This is preconfigure to connection to a Netezza machine.

  There are desktop icons on this Ubuntu image that will Start/Stop and exec Db2 Warehouse, Db2 Client and Harmony Profile.  All of these launchers are bash scripts located in ~/scripts directory.

  In the Db2Wh container are all the ddl and sql scripts needed to execute the labs.  

# Lab systems and presentations used during class

Here is a [link to a Box folder](https://ibm.box.com/v/IIASWorkshop) with presentations for you to follow along.  For further education, please look at the [Channel Technical Enablememt Guide](https://www.onlinedigitallearning.com/course/view.php?id=3716)

Based on availability, we will have access to and IBM Integrated Analytics System for you to review for the administration labs and DSX lab.   Complete the needful in the [Partner access document](./PartnerAccess.md)
